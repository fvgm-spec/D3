This is the step by step to run the HTML file on the web. Most code will go in index.html.

To run the example and see all the graphs, set up a local server by running the following line of code in command prompt:

- python -m http.server 8080

Make sure that in the CMD window you start the server, you are located in the same directory where the code is stored (the HTML file, all the sources that are in GitHub folder).

Then in your browser go to localhost:8000/index.html (replace the port or URL as required by your server set-up). The HTML will show the visualizations coming from the sources established.
