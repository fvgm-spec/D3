This is the step by step to run the HTML file on the web. Most code will go in idx.html.

To run the example and see all the graphs, set up a local server with either:

- python -m SimpleHTTPServer
- python3 -m http.server

Make sure to put in the folder where you are going to store the HTML file, all the sources that are in GitHub folder.

Then in your browser go to localhost:8000/idx.html (replace the port or URL as required by your server set-up). The HTML will show the visualizations coming from the sources established.
